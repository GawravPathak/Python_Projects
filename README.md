# Python_Projects : Web Scrapping
In this Project I have used this website
https://results.eci.gov.in/PcResultGenJune2024/index.htm
to create the table in python using BeautifulSoup Library from bs4
and then creating the .csv file.


# Python_Projects : Automatic File Sorting 
This project automatically move the files into their respective folders.
If you want to try : you can just change the Source path and the destination path
And make sure you will specify the file type you have and then create the corresponding directory for it.
